Problem Statement

- Matching clothes: Buying clothes that you thought was cute, but you aren't sure how to match it so you don't wear them and it goes to waste
- Consumerism & Social Media: Trap in the rabbit hole of overconsumerism to stay in trend by excessively buying "good-deal" clothes from fast-fashion brands; financially irresponsible and harmful for the environment (contribute to landfills and ephemeral fashion)
- Sustainability: Not knowing what's in our closets and purchasing clothes that are unnecessary and fast fashion.
